## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 

Our goal is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties.
 
As a result of this task the company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
 
The solution is divided into the following sections: 
- Data understanding and exploration
- Data cleaning
- Data preparation
- Model building and evaluation


- The dataset is provided in 'train.csv'. It contains 1460 records and 81 features in total

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The result shows that the best model is the Lasso with lambda 7 having the R2 value of 0.88
